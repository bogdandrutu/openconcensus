# Changelog

## Unreleased:

-----

## Version 0.12.0 - 2020-12-04

### API

#### Bugfixes

- Usages of tracers and meters on all `OpenTelemetry` instances were being delegated to the global Meter and Tracer.
This has been corrected, and all instances should have independent Tracer and Meter instances.

#### Breaking Changes

- The `AttributesBuilder` no long accepts null values for array-valued attributes with numeric or boolean types.
- The `TextMapPropagator.fields()` method now returns a `Collection` rather than a `List`.
- `Labels` has been converted to an interface, from an abstract class. Its API has otherwise remained the same.
- `TraceState` has been converted to an interface, from an abstract class. Its API has otherwise remained the same.
- `Attributes` has been converted to an interface, from an abstract class. Its API has otherwise remained the same.
- The `ReadableAttributes` interface has been removed, as it was redundant with the `Attributes` interface. All APIs that
used or returned `ReadableAttributes` should accept or return standard `Attributes` implementations.
- `SpanContext` has been converted to an interface, from an abstract class. Its API has otherwise remained the same.
- The functional `AttributeConsumer` interface has been removed and replaced with a standard `java.util.function.BiConsumer`.
- The signature of the `BaggageBuilder.put(String, String, EntryMetadata entryMetadata)` 
method has been changed to `put(String, String, BaggageEntryMetadata)`

#### Enhancements

- A `builder()` method has been added to the OpenTelemetry interface to facilitate constructing implementations.
- An `asMap()` method has been added to the `Attributes` interface to enable conversion to a standard `java.util.Map`.
- An `asMap()` method has been added to the `Baggage` interface to enable conversion to a standard `java.util.Map`.
- An `asMap()` method has been added to the `TraceState` interface to enable conversion to a standard `java.util.Map`.
- The Semantic Attributes constants have been updated to the version in the yaml spec as of Dec 1, 2020.

#### Miscellaneous

- The `HttpTraceContext` class has been deprecated in favor of `W3CTraceContextPropagator`. `HttpTraceContext` will be removed in 0.13.0.
- The `toBuilder()` method on the OpenTelemetry interface has been deprecated and will be removed in 0.13.0.
- The `DefaultContextPropagators` class has been deprecated. Access to it will be removed in 0.13.0.
- The `TraceMultiPropagator` builder has been deprecated in favor of a simple factory method. The builder will be removed in 0.13.0.
You can access the same functionality via static methods on the `ContextPropagators` interface. 
- The `setCallback()` method on the asynchronous metric instruments has been deprecated and will be removed in 0.13.0. 
Instead, use the `setCallback()` method on the builder for the instruments.
- The `value()` method on the `StatusCode` enum has been deprecated and will be removed in 0.13.0.
- The Baggage `EntryMetadata` class has been deprecated in favor of the `BaggageEntryMetadata` interface. The class will be made non-public in 0.13.0.

### Extensions

- The `opentelemetry-extension-runtime-metrics` module has been deprecated. The functionality is available in the 
opentelemetry-java-instrumentation project under a different module name. The module here will be removed in 0.13.0.
- The `trace-utils` module has been deprecated. If you need this module, please let us know! The module will be removed in 0.13.0.
 
### SDK

#### Breaking Changes

- The `opentelemetry-sdk-tracing` module has been renamed to `opentelemetry-sdk-trace`.
- The default port the OTLP exporters use has been changed to `4317`.
- The deprecated `SpanData.getCanonicalCode()` method has been removed, along with the implementations.

#### Enhancements

- The OpenTelemetrySdk builder now supports the addition of `SpanProcessor`s to the resulting SDK.
- The OpenTelemetrySdk builder now supports the assignment of an `IdGenerator` to the resulting SDK.
- The `ReadableSpan` interface now exposes the `Span.Kind` of the span.
- The SDK no longer depends on the guava library.
- The parent SpanContext is now exposed on the `SpanData` interface.

#### Miscellaneous

- The `toBuilder()` method on the OpenTelemetrySdk class has been deprecated and will be removed in 0.13.0.
- The MultiSpanProcessor and MultiSpanExporter have been deprecated. You can access the same functionality via
the `SpanProcessor.composite` and `SpanExporter.composite` methods. The classes will be made non-public in 0.13.0.
- The `SpanData.hasRemoteParent()` method has been deprecated and will be removed in 0.13.0. If you need this information,
you can now call `SpanData.getParentSpanContext().isRemote()`.
- The default timeouts for the 2 OTLP exporters and the Jaeger exporter have been changed to 10s from 1s.

### Extensions

#### Breaking Changes

- The `opentelemetry-sdk-extension-aws-v1-support` module has been renamed to `opentelemetry-sdk-extension-aws` 
and the classes in it have been repackaged into the `io.opentelemetry.sdk.extension.aws.*` packages.

#### Bugfixes:

- The OpenTracing `TracerShim` now properly handles keys for context extraction in a case-insensitive manner.

#### Enhancements

- The `opentelemetry-sdk-extension-resources` now includes resource attributes for the process runtime via the `ProcessRuntimeResource` class.

- The `opentelemetry-sdk-extension-aws` extension now will auto-detect AWS Lambda resource attributes.

-----

## Version 0.11.0 - 2020-11-18

### API

#### Breaking changes:

- The SPI interfaces have moved to a package (not a module) separate from the API packages, and now live in `io.opentelemetry.spi.*` package namespace.
- Builder classes have been moved to the top level, rather than being inner classes. 
For example, rather than `io.opentelemetry.api.trace.Span.Builder`, the builder is now in its own top-level class: `io.opentelemetry.api.trace.SpanBuilder`.
Methods to create the builders remain in the same place as they were before.
- SpanBuilder.setStartTimestamp, Span.end, and Span.addEvent methods which accept a timestamp now accept a timestamp with a TimeUnit instead of requiring a nanos timestamp.

#### Enhancements:

- Versions of SpanBuilder.setStartTimestamp, Span.end, and Span.addEvent added which accept Instant timestamps
- Setting the value of the `io.opentelemetry.context.contextStorageProvider` System property to `default` will enforce that
the default (thread local) ContextStorage will be used for the Context implementation, regardless of what SPI implementations are
available.

#### Miscellaneous:

- Invalid W3C `TraceState` entries will now be silently dropped, rather than causing the invalidation of the entire `TraceState`.

### SDK

#### Breaking Changes:

- The builder class for the `OpenTelemetrySdk` now strictly requires its components to be SDK implementations. 
You can only build an `OpenTelemetrySdk` with `TracerSdkProvider` and `MeterSdkProvider` instances.

#### Enhancements:

- An API has been added to the SDK's MeterProvider implementation (`MeterSdkProvider`) that allows the end-user to configure
how various metrics will be aggregated. This API should be considered a precursor to a full "Views" API, and will most likely
evolve over the coming months before the metrics implementation is complete. See the javadoc for `MeterSdkProvider.registerView()` for details.

#### Miscellaneous:

- The `SpanProcessor` interface now includes default method implementations for the `shutdown()` and `forceFlush()` methods.
- The BatchRecorder implementation has been updated to actually batch the recordings, rather than simply passing them through.

### Extensions

#### Breaking Changes:

- The `@WithSpan` annotation has been moved to the `io.opentelemetry.extension.annotations` package in the `opentelemetry-extension-annotations` module 

#### Bugfixes:

- The memory pool metrics provided by the MemoryPools class in the `opentelemetry-extension-runtime-metrics` module
have been fixed to properly report the committed memory values.
 
#### Enhancements:

- A new module has been added to assist with propagating the OTel context in kotlin co-routines. 
See the `opentelemetry-extension-kotlin` module for details.

-----

## Version 0.10.0 - 2020-11-06

### API

#### Enhancements

- The W3C Baggage Propagator is now available.
- The B3 Propagator now handles both single and multi-header formats.
- The B3 Propagator defaults to injecting the single B3 header, rather than the multi-header format.
- Mutating a method on `Span` now returns the `Span` to enable call-chaining.

#### Bug fixes

- The `package-info` file was removed from the `io.otel.context` package because it made the project incompatible with JPMS.

#### Breaking changes

- There have been many updates to the semantic conventions constants. The constants are now auto-generated from the YAML specification files, so the names will now be consistent across languages. For more information, see the [YAML Model for Semantic Conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/master/semantic_conventions).
- All API classes have been moved into the `io.opentelemetry.api.` prefix to support JPMS users.
- The API no longer uses the `grpc-context` as the context implementation. It now uses `io.opentelemetry.context.Context`. This is published in the `opentelemetry-context` artifact. Interactions with the context were mostly moved to static methods in the `Span` and `Baggage` interfaces.
- The Baggage API has been reworked to more closely match the specification. This includes the removal of the `BaggageManager`. Baggage is fully functional within the API, without needing to install an SDK.
- `TracingContextUtils` and `BaggageUtils` were removed from the public API. Instead, use the appropriate static methods on the `Span` and `Baggage` classes, or use methods on the `Context` itself.
- The context propagation APIs have moved into the new `opentelemetry-context` context module.
- `DefaultSpan` was removed from the public API. Instead, use `Span.wrap(spanContext)` if you need a non-functional span that propagates the trace context.
- `DefaultMeter`, `DefaultMeterProvider`, `DefaultTracer` and `DefaultTracerProvider` were removed from the public API. You can access the same functionality with `getDefault()` methods on the `Meter`, `MeterProvider, `Tracer`, and `TracerProvider` classes, respectively.
- Some functionality from the `Tracer` interface is now available either on the `Span` interface or `Context` interface.
- The `OpenTelemetry` class is now an interface, with implementations. Methods on this interface have changed their names to reflect this change. For more information, see [OpenTelemetry.java](/api/src/main/java/io/opentelemetry/api/OpenTelemetry.java).
- All builder-creation methods have been renamed to `.builder()`.
- `StatusCanonicalCode` has been renamed to `StatusCode`.
- `Span.getContext()` has been renamed to `Span.getSpanContext()`.
- `AttributesBuilder` now uses `put` instead of `add` as the method name for adding attributes.
- All parameters are now marked as non-nullable by default.
- `TextMapPropagators` could receive a null carrier passed to the extract method.
- The `TextMapPropagator.Getter` interface has added a method to return the keys that the propagator uses.

### SDK

#### Enhancements

- A new `MetricData` gauge metric type is now available. 
- A new `opentelemetry-sdk-testing` module with a JUnit 5 extension to assist with testing is now available.
- The Prometheus metric exporter now consumes `gauge` metrics.
- The Jaeger gRPC exporter now maps `Resource` entries to process tags.
- The OTLP protobuf definitions were updated to the latest released version: 0.6.0. Both the `Span` and `Metric` exporters were updated to match.
- The `Sampler` interface now allows a `Sampler` implementation to update the `TraceState` that is applied to the `SpanContext` for the resulting span.

#### Breaking changes

- `TraceConfig` configuration option names (environment variables and system properties) were renamed to match the OpenTelemetery Specification. For more information, see [TraceConfig](./QUICKSTART.md#TraceConfig).
- The Jaeger gRPC exporter was updated to match the OpenTelemetry Specification. The `message` log entry attribute has been renamed to `event` and a new `dropped attributes count` attribute was added. For more information, see the [Overview](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/overview.md).
- The `SpanData.getHasRemoteParent()` and `SpanData.getHasEnded()` methods were renamed to `hasRemoteParent()` and `hasEnded()`, respectively.
- The `IdsGenerator` interface has been renamed to `IdGenerator`, and all implementations and relevant factory methods were similarly renamed.
- The `RandomIdGenerator` is now accessible via a factory method on the `IdGenerator` class, rather than being exposed itself. Use `IdGenerator.random()` to acquire an instance.
- The OTLP metric exporter now emits `gauge` metrics where appropriate.
- `ValueObserver` instruments now generate gauge metrics, rather than non-monotonic counter-style metrics.
- `ValueObserver` instruments now use the `LastValue` aggregation instead of `MinMaxSumCount`.
- The `SpanData.*` implementation classes were removed from the public SDK, but the interfaces are still available.
- `SpanProcessor.onStart` now takes a `Context` as its first parameter.
- The `Sampler` interface now takes a parent `Context` rather than a `SpanContext`.
- Each `Sampler` has been reorganized into their own classes and moved into the `io.opentelemetry.sdk.trace.samplers` package. Factory methods that used to be on the `Samplers` class were moved to the `Sampler` interface.

### Extensions

#### Enhancements

- A new JUnit5 extension was added for writing tests. For more information, see [OpenTelemetryExtension.java](sdk/testing/src/main/java/io/opentelemetry/sdk/testing/junit5/OpenTelemetryExtension.java). 
- A Jaeger `SpanExporter` which exports via the `thrift-over-http protocol` is now available.
- A Jaeger Propagator is now available.

#### Breaking changes

- The in-memory exporter(s) have been moved to the `opentelemetry-sdk-testing` artifact.
- The OpenTracing shim factory class has been renamed from `TraceShim` to `OpenTracingShim`. The factory methods have changed because `BaggageManager` was removed and non-global `OpenTelemetry` instances are now available.
- The 's' was removed from the word "exporters" for every exporter artifact. For example, `opentelemetry-exporters-logging` was renamed to `opentelemetry-exporter-logging`. 
- The 's' was removed from the word "extensions" for the package for every SDK extension. For example, `io.opentelemetry.sdk.extensions.otproto.TraceProtoUtils` was renamed to `io.opentelemetry.sdk.extension.otproto.TraceProtoUtils`.
