# OpenTelemetry SDK Contrib - Auto Instrumentation Configuration Utilities

This module contains code to assist with configuring the SDK for the auto-instrumentation
project. It is temporarily a separate module from the SDK in order to stabilize
the APIs, then it will be moved into the SDK project proper.
