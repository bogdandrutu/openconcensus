/**
 * Meter is a simple, interface that allows users to record measurements (metrics).
 *
 * <p>There are two ways to record measurements:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Record raw measurements, and defer defining the aggregation and the labels for the exported
 *       Instrument. This should be used in libraries like gRPC to record measurements like
 *       "server_latency" or "received_bytes".
 *   <li>Record pre-defined aggregation data (or already aggregated data). This should be used to
 *       report cpu/memory usage, or simple metrics like "queue_length".
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>TODO: Update comment.
